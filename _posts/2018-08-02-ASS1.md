# Shanghai Wujiao Chang Area
Economic development are changing the basic nature and structure in Shanghai. Urban transformation can be refer to that Meet and upgrade the needs of the public by rethinking urban design and construction. In 1900s, Wu Jiaochang area was a center of Yang Pu District and there was many small shops and a farmer’s market. Because of the end of Shanghai Concession, the right of Municipal construction was given back to the Shanghai government. To develop Shanghai, not only the bund, government decided to renewal Wu Jiaochang area. Since Shanghai is a large city, Wu Jiaochang was planned to be the next CBD in Shanghai.

Firstly, Wu Jiaochang area was built a highway. It is Middle Ring Line which is the longest highway in Shanghai. It connects the east of Shanghai and west of Shanghai so that it offers another transportation method and to the workers and the people who needs transfer between the east and the west of Shanghai in a short time, it is a successful urban transformation. Because this middle ring line, the traffic efficiency in Wu Jiaochang area has been increased 30%. However, for the people who live in Wu Jiangchang area, because of the urban renewal, the Wu Jiaochang primary school was moved to another place so that it is inconvenience.

Secondly, the subway system was built. Wujiao Chang subway station is one of the entrance stations of Shanghai subway network. Line 8, line 10 and line 12 constitute the underground transportation network of Wujiao Chang and run through the east and west of Shanghai. This provides a fast channel for residents in the wujichang area of Shanghai to communicate directly with places like yangbu, baoshan and Pudong. The residents of Wujiao Chang do not have to go to the city center first and then cross the river as before to pudong. This also met the requirements of Wujiao Chang residents to quickly reach the city center. And according to statistics, people’s travel efficiency has been improved by 60% since the subway system was built. However, this subway is still blank in the north-south direction of traffic and does not provide residents with a fast passageway up the north-south direction.
